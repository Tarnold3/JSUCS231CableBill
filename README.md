# JSUCS231CableBill

This program was designed to calculate someone's cable bill after getting specific user input. The user has to specify their account number and customer type (residential or business). Then, based on their choices, the program applies the rates over the amount of channels purchased that the user also specifies in the command prompt. After this it then displays the account number and the amount due for the cable bill. If an incorrect customer type was given the program will display "Invalid customer type." or give an error.
